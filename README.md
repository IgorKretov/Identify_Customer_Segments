## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

The data and design for this project were provided by Arvato Financial Services. A Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Project-Term1.

1. CLUSTERING: Learn the basics of clustering Data, Cluster data with the K-means algorithm
2. HIERARCHICAL AND DENSITY-BASED CLUSTERING: Cluster data with Single Linkage Clustering, Cluster data with DBSCAN, a clustering method that captures the insight that clusters are a dense group of points.
3. GAUSSIAN MIXTURE MODELS: Cluster data with Gaussian Mixture Models, Optimize Gaussian Mixture Models with Expectation Maximization
4. PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS: Reduce the dimensionality of the data using Principal Component Analysis through exploring handwritten digits
5. RANDOM PROJECTIONS & INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS: Explore noise signal data from a cello, a television, and a piano using additional methods of dimensionality reduction

## Results<a name="results"></a>
 
I have applied unsupervised learning techniques on demographic and spending data for a sample of German households. I have preprocessed the data, applied dimensionality reduction techniques and implemented clustering algorithms to segment customers with the goal of optimizing customer outreach for a mail-order company.
