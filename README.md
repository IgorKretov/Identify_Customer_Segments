# Identify_Customer_Segments

The data and design for this project were provided by Arvato Financial Services. I have applied unsupervised learning techniques on demographic and spending data for a sample of German households. I have preprocessed the data, applied dimensionality reduction techniques, and implemented clustering algorithms to segment customers with the goal of optimizing customer outreach for a mail-order company.
